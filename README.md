# FlashCards
Very basic application to help in learning foreigh words. It's based on a well-known concept of a paper card, with foreign word written on one side and translation - on another. In the app, cards are organized in stacks and each card can contain an image. The app has a multilanguage UI (Russian and English so far). Each card has an additional field named _Comment_, utilizable on your discretion. In the app's settings there's an option to select what side of the card the comment field will be shown on. For example, write there a transcription and select _Foreign_ side of the card to show it alongside with the foreign word. Or a nuance of usage (i.e. AmE/BrE) etc. 

**Memorizing words:** select stack, press _Learn_, select desired language on cards' faces via drop-dow list. Look at the word, if you know the translation - press _Known!_ and it'll be not shown again until you finish learning. If you don't know the translation - click on the word, try to memorize, then click _Unknown!_ - thus you tell the app to show the word again later. The app will continue showing cards until you mark all of them as known. Counter on the top shown thq quntity of cards remaining.


TODO list: 
- counters of words and attempts
- test mode in addition to learning mode
- image operations (check format, auto resize)

You're free to use the app anyway you want, preserving original author notice.
