# FlashCards
Very basic application to help in learning foreigh words. It's based on a well-known concept of a paper card, with foreign word written on one side and translation - on another. In the app, cards are organized in stacks and each card can contain an image. The app has a multilanguage UI (Russian and English so far).

**Memorizing words:** select stack, press _Learn_, select desired language on cards' faces via drop-dow list. Look at the word, if you know the translation - press _Known!_ and it'll be not shown again until you finish learning. If you don't know the translation - click on the word, try to memorize, then click _Unknown!_ - thus you tell the app to show the word again later. The app will continue showing cards until you mark all of them as known. 


TODO list: 
- counters of words and attempts
- test mode in addition to learning mode
- image operations (check format, auto resize)

You're free to use the app anyway you want, preserving original author notice.
